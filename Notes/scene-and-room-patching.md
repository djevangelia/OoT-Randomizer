# Parser

FileDataRelocator is the main class for shifting and extending scene and room files. Scene file entries are read from the rom's scene table connected with the DMA table. Room files are read as they are discovered in scene headers, also referencing the DMA table. FileDataRelocator is subclassed for both scenes and rooms in order to implement custom header parsers for each.

File data is stored using two concepts:

1. DataRecord - Raw byte data.
2. Pointer Records - A DataRecord stored as a property of a parent DataRecord. Pointer Records can be located in different files than the DataRecord they reference. There is no "PointerRecord" class as all data types encountered in scene and room files are explicitly defined.

Parsing starts with creating a DataRecord for the current scene header. Everytime a segment address is encountered in a scene/room header, a new DataRecord is created linked to that header. This occurs recursively for subsequent segment addresses encountered while parsing these DataRecords, such as scene headers referencing alternate headers referencing scene collision headers referencing vertex/polygon/surface/camera/waterbox lists.

Unreferenced data in any file is added as an Unknown record type of fixed length after all other records have been identified and parsed. Unknown records should not be modified, moved, or removed.

DataRecords with a known type are merged after parsing to simplify patching in randomizer hacks.

DataRecords are subclassed into classes specific to a given scene command, such as SceneTransitionActorList. Private class properties use the standard "_" prefix. All other properties can be freely modified. When writing back to the rom during patching, attritbutes are automatically converted to whatever byte format they use. Record offsets are shifted as needed along with any related pointers. References to scene/room resources outside of the files (mostly cutscenes) are manually defined based on a search of decomp ntsc-1.0 and updated when writing to ROM. Finally, the scene table is rewritten to use the new file start and end addresses.

Note that MQ dungeon support changes the following record types:

- Scene Transition Actors
- Scene Paths
- Scene Collision polygons, surfaces, and camera info
- Room Objects
- Room Actors

Make sure to perform scene/room changes after MQ patching to avoid conflicts.

To prevent conflicts between this system and directly writing to the ROM, an exception will be thrown if any writes are attempted between VROM 0x01F12000 - 0x03470F20.

Formatting info: https://wiki.cloudmodding.com/oot/Scenes_and_Rooms
As of 2024, scenes and rooms are not included in the decomp repo, but they can be extracted to human-readable C code and PNG texture files by building one of the supported versions. Scene and room files get placed in `extracted/<VERSION>/assets/scenes`, sorted in subfolders by area type and scene name. Rooms are placed in the same subfolder as their parent scene. See https://wiki.cloudmodding.com/oot/File_List/NTSC_1.0#File_1007_to_1495_.28Scenes_.26_Rooms.29 for a list of all the scene and room files relevant to rando.

VROM start of scenes/rooms: 0x01F12000
VROM end of scenes/rooms:   0x03470F20

# Gold Skulltulas

Param `0xA000` makes them spawn at night, `0x8000` will always spawn.
Always set for overworld scenes with changing time.
Night-only room setups may also have this set for en_sw instances.

# Cutscenes

Safe to use CS_END_OF_SCRIPT() as terminator and just read in all the raw bytes if we're feeling lazy. Decomp doesn't show any commands past it for any cutscene despite cloudmodding suggesting that there may be commands past it. Command bytes are 0xFFFFFFFF. Note that this assumption is an artifact of how ZAPD parses the cutscenes and may not be accurate!!

Store these in a way that Cutscenes.py can index them for its changes.

Cutscene commands have variable lengths. Below is how to determine command length by command ID, sourced from ZAPD's `ZCutscene.cpp` and `CutsceneOoT_Commands.cpp` files.

CS_HEADER always at start of cutscene commands. No explicit ID.
    numCommands: s32
    endFrame: s32
    total size = 0x08

CS_END always at end of cutscene commands. 0xFFFFFFFF ID plus 0x04 bytes padding.
    total size = 0x08
